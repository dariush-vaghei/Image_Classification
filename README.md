# Image Classification
A python implementation of image classification using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) on the CIFAR-10 dataset. It demonstrates how to load the dataset, create a CNN model, train it, and make predictions.
### Prerequisites
- TensorFlow
- Keras
- Matplotlib
- NumPy
- scikit-image
## Steps
* Data loading and preprocessing:
  * Loading the CIFAR-10 dataset.
  * Preprocessing the data, including normalization.
* Model creation:
  * Building a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN).
  * Configuring convolutional layers, max-pooling, snd dense layers.
* Model training:
  * Defining training parameters (e.g., epochs, batch size).
  * Training the CNN on the training dataset.
* Model saving and loading:
  * Saving the trained model to a file.
  * Loading a pre-trained model for reuse.
* Making predictions:
  * Using the loaded model to make predictions on new images.
